# DAN-x-multiple-ai

Use the classic **DAN jailbreak** with a bunch of different AIs — all in one place.

## What This Repo Is

A small collection of text files containing jailbreak-style prompts. Each file is a different method you can copy and use with whatever AI you’re testing.

## How to Use

1. Open a prompt file
2. Copy everything
3. Paste it into the AI chat
4. That’s literally it

## Contributing

Got another DAN-style jailbreak for a different AI? Add a new `.txt` file and throw it in.
