A small collection of text files containing jailbreak-style prompts. Each file is a different method you can copy and use with whatever AI you're testing.

## <img src="https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@latest/icons/rocket.svg" width="24" height="24" alt="Rocket Icon"> How to Use

1. **Open a prompt file** — Browse the collection and find the jailbreak you want
2. **Copy everything** — Select all the text from the file
3. **Paste it into the AI chat** — Drop it directly into your AI's chat interface
4. **That's literally it** — Watch the magic happen
