Use the classic **DAN jailbreak** with a bunch of different AIs — all in one place.

## What This Repo Is

A small collection of text files containing jailbreak-style prompts. Each file is a different method you can copy and use with whatever AI you're testing.

## How to Use

1. **Open a prompt file** — Browse the collection and find the jailbreak you want
2. **Copy everything** — Select all the text from the file
3. **Paste it into the AI chat** — Drop it directly into your AI's chat interface
4. **That's literally it** — Watch the magic happen

## Contributing

- Create a new `.txt` file with your jailbreak prompt
- Use a clear filename (e.g., `claude-dan.txt`)
- Submit a pull request
